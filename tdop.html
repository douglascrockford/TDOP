<h1>Top Down Operator Precedence</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/pratt.html">Vaughan Pratt</a> presented
  <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512931">"Top Down Operator
  Precedence"</a> at the first annual <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/popl.htm">Principles
  of Programming Languages Symposium</a> in Boston in 1973. In the paper
  Pratt described a parsing technique that combines the best properties
  of Recursive Descent and <a href="http://sigact.acm.org/floyd/">Floyd</a>'s
  Operator Precedence. It is easy to use. It feels a lot like Recursive
  Descent, but with the need for less code and with significantly better
  performance. He claimed the technique is simple to understand, trivial
  to implement, easy to use, extremely efficient, and very flexible. It
  is dynamic, providing support for truly extensible languages. </p>
<p>Oddly enough, such an obviously utopian approach to compiler construction
  is completely neglected today. Why is this? Pratt suggested in the paper
  that a preoccupation with BNF grammars and their various offspring, along
  with their related automata and theorems, has precluded development in
  directions that are not visibly in the domain of automata theory.</p>

<p>Another explanation is that his technique is most effective when used
  in a dynamic, functional programming language. Its use in a static, procedural
  language would be considerably more difficult. In the paper, Pratt used
  LISP and almost effortlessly built parse trees from streams of tokens.
  But parsing techniques are not greatly valued in the LISP community, which
  celebrates the Spartan denial of syntax. There have been many attempts
  since LISP's creation to give the language a rich ALGOL-like syntax, including
  <a href="http://zane.brouhaha.com/%7Ehealyzh/doc/cgol.doc.txt">Pratt's
  CGOL</a>, <a href="http://community.computerhistory.org/scc/projects/LISP/index.html#LISP_2_">LISP
  2</a>, <a href="ftp://reports.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/68/92/CS-TR-68-92.pdf">MLISP</a>,
  <a href="http://www.opendylan.org/">Dylan</a>, <a href="http://community.computerhistory.org/scc/projects/LISP/interlisp/Teitelman-3IJCAI.pdf">Interlisp's
  Clisp</a>, and <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/lisp.html">McCarthy's
  original M-expressions</a>. All failed to find acceptance. That community
  found the correspondence between programs and data to be much more valuable
  than expressive syntax. But the mainstream programming community likes
  its syntax, so LISP has never been accepted by the mainstream. Pratt's
  technique wants a dynamic language, but dynamic language communities historically
  have had no use for the syntax that Pratt's technique conveniently realizes.</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>The situation changes with the advent of JavaScript.
JavaScript is a dynamic, functional language, but syntactically it is obviously
a member of the C family. It is a dynamic language with a community that likes
syntax.</p>

<p>JavaScript is also object-oriented. Pratt's 1973 paper anticipated object orientation
  but lacked an expressive notation for it. JavaScript is an ideal
  language for exploiting Pratt's technique. I will show that we can quickly
  and inexpensively produce parsers in JavaScript.</p>

<p>We don't have time in this short chapter to deal with the whole JavaScript
  language, and perhaps we wouldn't want to because the language is a mess.
  But it has some brilliant stuff in it that is well worth consideration.
  We will build a parser that can process Simplified JavaScript. We will
  write the parser in Simplified JavaScript. Simplified JavaScript is just
  the good stuff, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functions as first class objects. Functions in Simplified JavaScript
    are lambdas with lexical scoping.</li>
 <li>Dynamic objects with prototypal inheritance. Objects are
     class-free. We can add a new member to any object by ordinary assignment.
     An object can inherit members from another object.</li>
 <li>Object literals and array literals. This is a very convenient notation for
     creating new objects and arrays. JavaScript literals were the inspiration
     for the <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> data interchange format.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will take advantage of JavaScript's prototypal nature to make token
  objects that inherit from symbols. Our implementation depends on an <code>Object.create</code>
  method (which makes a new object that inherits members from an existing
  object) and a tokenizer (which produces an array of simple token objects
  from a string). We will advance through this array of tokens as we grow
  our parse tree. </p>
<h2>Symbol Table</h2>

<p>Every token, such as an operator or identifier, will inherit from a symbol.
  We will keep all of our symbols (which determine the types of tokens in
  our language) in a <code>symbol_table</code> object.</p>

<pre>var symbol_table = {};</pre>
<p>The <code>original_symbol</code> object is the prototype for all other
  symbols. Its methods will usually be overridden. (We will describe the
  role of <code>nud</code> and <code>led</code> and binding powers in the
  section on Precedence below). </p>
<pre>var original_symbol = {
    nud: function () {
        this.error("Undefined.");
    },
    led: function (left) {
        this.error("Missing operator.");
    }
};</pre>

<p>Let's define a function that makes symbols. It takes a symbol <code>id</code>
  and an optional binding power that defaults to 0 and returns a symbol
  object for that <code>id</code>. If the symbol already exists in the <code>symbol_table</code>,
  the function returns that symbol object. Otherwise, it makes a new symbol
  object that inherits from the <code>original_symbol</code>, stores it
  in the symbol table, and returns it. A symbol object initially contains
  an <code>id</code>, a value, a left binding power, and the stuff it inherits
  from the <code>original_symbol</code>. </p>

<pre>var symbol = function (id, bp) {
    var s = symbol_table[id];
    bp = bp || 0;
    if (s) {
        if (bp &gt;= s.lbp) {
            s.lbp = bp;
        }
    } else {
        s = Object.create(original_symbol);
        s.id = s.value = id;
        s.lbp = bp;
        symbol_table[id] = s;
    }
    return s;
};</pre>

<p>The following symbols are popular separators and closers.</p>
<pre>symbol(":");
symbol(";");
symbol(",");
symbol(")");
symbol("]");
symbol("}");
symbol("else");</pre>

<p>The <code>(end)</code> symbol indicates the end of the token stream.
  The <code>(name)</code> symbol is the prototype for new names, such as
  variable names. The parentheses that I've included in the ids of these
  symbols avoid collisions with user-defined tokens.</p>

<pre>symbol("(end)");
symbol("(name)");</pre>

<h2>Tokens</h2>

<p>We assume that the source text has been transformed into an array of
  simple token objects (<code>tokens</code>), each containing a <code>type</code>
  member (<code>"name"</code>, <code>"string"</code>, <code>"number"</code>,
  or <code>"operator"</code>), and a <code>value</code> member, which is
  a string or number.</p>

<p>The <code>token</code> variable always contains the current token.</p>

<pre>var token;</pre>

<p>The <code>advance</code> function makes a new token object from the next
  simple token in the array and assigns it to the <code> token</code> variable.
  It can take an optional <code>id</code> parameter which it can check against
  the <code>id</code> of the previous token. The new token object's prototype
  is a <code>(name)</code> token in the current scope or a symbol from the
  symbol table. The new token's <code>arity</code> is <code>"name"</code>,
  <code>"literal"</code>, or <code>"operator"</code>. Its <code>arity</code>
  may be changed later to <code>"binary"</code>, <code>"unary"</code>, or
  <code>"statement"</code> when we know more about the token's role in the
  program.</p>

<pre>var advance = function (id) {
    var a, o, t, v;
    if (id &amp;&amp; token.id !== id) {
        token.error("Expected '" + id + "'.");
    }
    if (token_nr &gt;= tokens.length) {
        token = symbol_table["(end)"];
        return;
    }
    t = tokens[token_nr];
    token_nr += 1;
    v = t.value;
    a = t.type;
    if (a === "name") {
        o = scope.find(v);
    } else if (a === "operator") {
        o = symbol_table[v];
        if (!o) {
            t.error("Unknown operator.");
        }
    } else if (a === "string" || a ===  &quot;number") {
        a = "literal";
        o = symbol_table["(literal)"];
    } else {
        t.error("Unexpected token.");
    }
    token = Object.create(o);
    token.value = v;
    token.arity = a;
    return token;
};</pre>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>Most languages have some notation for defining new symbols (such as variable
  names). In a very simple language, when we encounter a new word, we might
  give it a definition and put it in the symbol table. In a more sophisticated
  language, we would want to have scope, giving the programmer convenient
  control over the lifespan and visibility of a variable. </p>

<p>A scope is a region of a program in which a variable is defined and
accessible. Scopes can be nested inside of other scopes. Variables
defined in a scope are not visible outside of the scope.</p>

<p>We will keep the current scope object in the <code>scope</code> variable. </p>
<pre>var scope;</pre>
<p>The <code>original_scope</code> is the prototype for all scope objects. It
  contains a <code>define</code> method that is used to define new variables
  in the scope. The <code>define</code> method transforms a name token into a
  variable token. It produces an error if the variable has already been defined
  in the scope or if the name has already been used as a reserved word.</p>

<pre>var itself = function () {
    return this;
};</pre>

<pre>var original_scope = {
    define: function (n) {
        var t = this.def[n.value];
        if (typeof t === "object") {
            n.error(t.reserved ?
                "Already reserved." :
                "Already defined.");
        }
        this.def[n.value] = n;
        n.reserved = false;
        n.nud      = itself;
        n.led      = null;
        n.std      = null;
        n.lbp      = 0;
        n.scope    = scope;
        return n;
    },</pre>

<p>The <code>find</code> method is used to find the definition of a name.
  It starts with the current scope and seeks, if necessary, back through
  the chain of parent scopes and ultimately to the symbol table. It returns
  <code>symbol_table["(name)&quot;]</code> if it cannot find a definition.</p>
<p>The <code>find</code> method tests the values it finds to determine that
they are not <code>undefined</code> (which would indicate an undeclared name)
and not a function (which would indicate a collision with an inherited method).</p>

<pre>    find: function (n) {
            var e = this, o;
            while (true) {
                o = e.def[n];
                if (o && typeof o !== 'function') {
                    return e.def[n];
                }
                e = e.parent;
                if (!e) {
                    o = symbol_table[n];
                    return o && typeof o !== 'function' ?
                            o : symbol_table["(name)"];
                }
            }
        },</pre>

<p>The <code>pop</code> method closes a scope, giving focus back to the
  parent.</p>

<pre>    pop: function () {
        scope = this.parent;
    },</pre>

<p>The <code>reserve</code> method is used to indicate that a name has been
used as a reserved word in the current scope.</p>

<pre>    reserve: function (n) {
        if (n.arity !== "name" || n.reserved) {
            return;
        }
        var t = this.def[n.value];
        if (t) {
            if (t.reserved) {
                return;
            }
            if (t.arity === "name") {
                n.error("Already defined.");
            }
        }
        this.def[n.value] = n;
        n.reserved = true;
    }
};</pre>

<p>We need a policy for reserved words. In some languages, words that are used
  structurally (such as <code>if</code>) are reserved and cannot be used as variable
  names. The flexibility of our parser allows us to have a more useful policy.
  For example, we can say that in any function, any name may be used as a structure
  word or as a variable, but not as both. We will reserve words locally only after
  they are used as reserved words. This makes things better for the language designer
  because adding new structure words to the language will not break existing programs,
  and it makes things better for programmers because they are not hampered by
  irrelevant restrictions on the use of names.</p>

<p>Whenever we want to establish a new scope for a function or
a block we call the <code>new_scope</code> function, which makes a new
instance of the original scope prototype.</p>

<pre>var new_scope = function () {
    var s = scope;
    scope = Object.create(original_scope);
    scope.def = {};
    scope.parent = s;
    return scope;
};</pre>

<h2>Precedence</h2>

<p>Tokens are objects that bear methods allowing them to make precedence
  decisions, match other tokens, and build trees (and in a more ambitious
  project, also check types and optimize and generate code). The basic precedence
  problem is this: Given an operand between two operators, is the operand
  bound to the left operator or the right?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><code> d&nbsp;</code><i>A</i><code>&nbsp;e&nbsp;</code><i>B</i><code>&nbsp;f</code></p>

<p>If <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are operators, does operand <code>e</code> bind
  to <i>A</i> or to <i>B</i>? In other words, are we talking about </p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><code> (d&nbsp;</code><i>A</i><code>
  e)&nbsp;</code><i>B</i><code>&nbsp;f&nbsp;&nbsp; </code>or<code> &nbsp;&nbsp;d&nbsp;</code><i>A</i><code>&nbsp;(e&nbsp;</code><i>B</i><code>
  f)&nbsp;</code>?</p>

<p>Ultimately, the complexity in the process of parsing comes down to the
  resolution of this ambiguity. The technique we will develop here uses
  token objects whose members include binding powers (or precedence levels),
  and simple methods called <code>nud</code> (null denotation) and <code>led</code>
  (left denotation). A <code>nud</code> does not care about the tokens to
  the left. A <code>led</code> does. A <code> nud</code> method is used
  by values (such as variables and literals) and by prefix operators. A
  <code>led</code> method is used by infix operators and suffix operators.
  A token may have both a <code>nud</code> method and a <code> led</code>
  method. For example, <code>-</code> might be both a prefix operator (negation)
  and an infix operator (subtraction), so it would have both <code>nud</code>
  and <code>led</code> methods. </p>
<p>In our parser, we will use these binding powers:</p>
<table border="2" align="center"><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>non-binding operators like <code><code>;</code></code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>assignment operators like <code><code>=</code></code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20</td>
    <td><code><code>?</code></code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30</td>
    <td><code>|| &amp;&amp;</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>40</td>
    <td>relational operators like <code>===</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>50</td>
    <td><code>+ -</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>60</td>
    <td><code>* /</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>70</td>
    <td>unary operators like <code>!</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>80</td>
    <td><code>. [ (</code></td>
  </tr></tbody>
</table>
<h2>Expressions</h2>

<p>The heart of Pratt's technique is the <code>expression</code> function.
  It takes a right binding power that controls how aggressively it binds
  to tokens on its right. </p>

<pre>var expression = function (rbp) {
    var left;
    var t = token;
    advance();
    left = t.nud();
    while (rbp &lt; token.lbp) {
        t = token;
        advance();
        left = t.led(left);
    }
    return left;
}</pre>

<p><code>expression</code> calls the <code>nud</code> method of the
<code>token</code>. The <code>nud</code> is used to process literals,
variables, and prefix operators. Then as long as the right binding
power is less than the left binding power of the next token, the
<code>led</code> method is invoked on the following token. The <code>led</code> is used
to process infix and suffix operators. This process can be recursive
because the <code>nud</code> and <code>led</code> methods
can call <code>expression</code>.</p>

<h2>Infix Operators</h2>

<p>The <code>+</code> operator is an infix operator, so it has a <code>
  led</code> method that weaves the token object into a tree whose two branches
  (<code>first</code> and <code>second</code>) are the operand to the left
  of the <code>+</code> and the operand to the right. The left operand is
  passed into the <code>led</code>, which then obtains the right operand
  by calling the <code>expression</code> function. </p>

<pre>symbol("+", 50).led = function (left) {
    this.first = left;
    this.second = expression(50);
    this.arity = "binary";
    return this;
};</pre>

<p>The symbol for <code>*</code> is the same as <code>+</code> except for
  the <code>id</code> and binding powers. It has a higher binding power
  because it binds more tightly.</p>

<pre>symbol("*", 60).led = function (left) {
    this.first = left;
    this.second = expression(60);
    this.arity = "binary";
    return this;
};</pre>

<p>Not all infix operators will be this similar, but many will, so we can
  make our work easier by defining an <code>infix</code> function that will
  help us make symbols for infix operators. The <code>infix</code> function
  takes an <code>id</code>, a binding power, and an optional <code>led</code>
  function. If a <code>led</code> function is not provided, the <code>infix</code>
  function supplies a default <code>led</code> that is useful in most cases.</p>

<pre>var infix = function (id, bp, led) {
    var s = symbol(id, bp);
    s.led = led || function (left) {
        this.first = left;
        this.second = expression(bp);
        this.arity = "binary";
        return this;
    };
    return s;
}</pre>

<p>This allows a more declarative style for specifying infix operators:</p>

<pre>infix("+", 50);
infix("-", 50);
infix("*", 60);
infix("/", 60);</pre>

<p><code>===</code> is JavaScript's exact equality comparison operator.</p>

<pre>infix("===", 40);
infix("!==", 40);
infix("&lt;", 40);
infix("&lt;=", 40);
infix("&gt;", 40);
infix("&gt;=", 40);</pre>

<p>The ternary operator takes three expressions, separated by <code>?</code>
and <code>:</code>. It is not an ordinary infix operator, so we need to supply
its <code>led</code> function.</p>

<pre>infix("?", 20, function (left) {
    this.first = left;
    this.second = expression(0);
    advance(":");
    this.third = expression(0);
    this.arity = "ternary";
    return this;
});</pre>

<p>The <code>.</code> operator is used to select a member of an object. The token
  on the right must be a name, but it will be used as a literal.</p>

<pre>infix(".", 80, function (left) {
    this.first = left;
    if (token.arity !== "name") {
        token.error("Expected a property name.");
    }
    token.arity = "literal";
    this.second = token;
    this.arity = "binary";
    advance();
    return this;
});</pre>

<p>The <code>[</code> operator is used to dynamically select a member
from an object or array. The expression on the right must be followed
by a closing <code>]</code>.</p>

<pre>infix("[", 80, function (left) {
    this.first = left;
    this.second = expression(0);
    this.arity = "binary";
    advance("]");
    return this;
});</pre>

<p>Those infix operators are left associative. We can also make right associative
  operators, such as short-circuiting logical operators, by reducing the
  right binding power.</p>

<pre>var infixr = function (id, bp, led) {
    var s = symbol(id, bp);
    s.led = led || function (left) {
        this.first = left;
        this.second = expression(bp - 1);
        this.arity = "binary";
        return this;
    };
    return s;
}</pre>
<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator returns the first operand if the
  first operand is falsy. Otherwise, it returns the second operand. The
  <code>||</code> operator returns the first operand if the first operand
  is truthy. Otherwise, it returns the second operand. (The falsy values
  are the number <code>0</code>, the empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>,
  and the values <code>false</code> and <code>null</code>. All other values
  (including all objects) are truthy.)</p>

<pre>infixr("&amp;&amp;", 30);
infixr("||", 30);</pre>

<h2>Prefix Operators</h2>

<p>The code we used for right associative infix operators can be adapted
  for prefix operators. Prefix operators are right associative. A prefix
  does not have a left binding power because it does not bind to the left.
  Prefix operators can also sometimes be reserved words.</p>

<pre>var prefix = function (id, nud) {
    var s = symbol(id);
    s.nud = nud || function () {
        scope.reserve(this);
        this.first = expression(70);
        this.arity = "unary";
        return this;
    };
    return s;
}</pre>
<pre>prefix("-");
prefix("!");
prefix("typeof");</pre>

<p>The <code>nud</code> of <code>(</code> will call <code>advance(")")</code>
  to match a balancing <code>)</code> token. The <code>(</code> token does
  not become part of the parse tree because the <code>nud</code> returns
  the inner expression. </p>

<pre>prefix("(", function () {
    var e = expression(0);
    advance(")");
    return e;
});</pre>

<h2>Assignment Operators</h2>

<p>We could use <code>infixr</code> to define our assignment operators,
  but we will make a specialized <code>assignment</code> function because
  we want it to do two extra bits of business: examine the left operand
  to make sure that it is a proper lvalue, and set an <code>assignment</code>
  member so that we can later quickly identify assignment statements. </p>

<pre>var assignment = function (id) {
    return infixr(id, 10, function (left) {
        if (left.id !== "." &amp;&amp; left.id !== "[" &amp;&amp;
                left.arity !== "name") {
            left.error("Bad lvalue.");
        }
        this.first = left;
        this.second = expression(9);
        this.assignment = true;
        this.arity = "binary";
        return this;
    });
};</pre>

<pre>assignment("=");
assignment("+=");
assignment("-=");</pre>

<p>Notice that we have implemented a sort of inheritance pattern, where
<code>assignment</code> returns the result of calling <code>infixr</code>,
and <code>infixr</code> returns the result of calling <code>symbol</code>.</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>The <code>constant</code>
function builds constants into the language. The <code>nud</code> mutates a name token into a literal
token.</p>

<pre>var constant = function (s, v) {
    var x = symbol(s);
    x.nud = function () {
        scope.reserve(this);
        this.value = symbol_table[this.id].value;
        this.arity = "literal";
        return this;
    };
    x.value = v;
    return x;
};</pre>

<pre>constant("true", true);
constant("false", false);
constant("null", null);</pre>

<p>The <code>(literal)</code> symbol is the prototype for all string and
  number literals. The <code>nud</code> method of a literal token returns
  the token itself.</p>

<pre>symbol("(literal)").nud = itself;</pre>


<h2>Statements</h2>

<p>Pratt's original formulation worked with functional languages in which
  everything is an expression. Most mainstream languages have statements
  that are not as nestable as expressions. We can easily handle statements
  by adding another method to tokens, the <code>std</code> (statement denotation).
  A <code>std</code> is like a <code>nud</code> except that it is used only
  at the beginning of a statement.</p>

<p>The <code>statement</code> function parses one statement. If the current
  token has an <code>std</code> method, the token is reserved and the <code>std</code>
  is invoked. Otherwise,we assume an expression statement terminated with
  a semi-colon. For reliability, we will reject an expression statement
  that is not an assignment or invocation.</p>

<pre>var statement = function () {
    var n = token, v;
    if (n.std) {
        advance();
        scope.reserve(n);
        return n.std();
    }
    v = expression(0);
    if (!v.assignment &amp;&amp; v.id !== "(") {
        v.error("Bad expression statement.");
    }
    advance(";");
    return v;
};</pre>

<p>The <code>statements</code> function parses statements until it sees
  <code>(end)</code> or <code>}</code> which signals the end of a block.
  The function returns a statement, an array of statements, or <code>null</code>
  if there were no statements present.</p>

<pre>var statements = function () {
    var a = [], s;
    while (true) {
        if (token.id === "}" || token.id === "(end)") {
            break;
        }
        s = statement();
        if (s) {
            a.push(s);
        }
    }
    return a.length === 0 ? null : a.length === 1 ? a[0] : a;
};</pre>

<p>The <code>stmt</code> function is used to add statement symbols to the
  symbol table. It takes a statement <code>id</code> and an <code>std</code>
  function.</p>

<pre>var stmt = function (s, f) {
    var x = symbol(s);
    x.std = f;
    return x;
};</pre>

<p>The block statement wraps a pair of curly braces around a list of statements,
  giving them a new scope. (JavaScript does not have block scope. Simplified
  JavaScript corrects that.)</p>

<pre>stmt("{", function () {
    new_scope();
    var a = statements();
    advance("}");
    scope.pop();
    return a;
});</pre>

<p>The block function parses a block.</p>

<pre>var block = function () {
    var t = token;
    advance("{");
    return t.std();
};</pre>

<p>The <code>var</code> statement defines one or more variables in the current
  block. Each name can optionally be followed by <code>=</code> and an initializing
  expression. </p>

<pre>stmt("var", function () {
    var a = [], n, t;
    while (true) {
        n = token;
        if (n.arity !== "name") {
            n.error("Expected a new variable name.");
        }
        scope.define(n);
        advance();
        if (token.id === "=") {
            t = token;
            advance("=");
            t.first = n;
            t.second = expression(0);
            t.arity = "binary";
            a.push(t);
        }
        if (token.id !== ",") {
            break;
        }
        advance(",");
    }
    advance(";");
    return a.length === 0 ? null : a.length === 1 ? a[0] : a;
});</pre>

<p>The <code>while</code> statement defines a loop. It contains an expression
  in parens and a block. </p>

<pre>stmt("while", function () {
    advance("(");
    this.first = expression(0);
    advance(")");
    this.second = block();
    this.arity = "statement";
    return this;
});</pre>

<p>The <code>if</code> statement allows for conditional execution. If we
  see the <code> else</code> symbol after the block, then we parse the next
  block or <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<pre>stmt("if", function () {
    advance("(");
    this.first = expression(0);
    advance(")");
    this.second = block();
    if (token.id === "else") {
        scope.reserve(token);
        advance("else");
        this.third = token.id === "if" ? statement() : block();
    } else {
        this.third = null;
    }
    this.arity = "statement";
    return this;
});</pre>

<p>The <code>break</code> statement is used to break out of loops. </p>

<pre>stmt("break", function () {
    advance(";");
    if (token.id !== "}") {
        token.error("Unreachable statement.");
    }
    this.arity = "statement";
    return this;
});</pre>

<p>The <code>return</code> statement is used to return from functions. It
  can take an optional expression.</p>

<pre>stmt("return", function () {
    if (token.id !== ";") {
        this.first = expression(0);
    }
    advance(";");
    if (token.id !== "}") {
        token.error("Unreachable statement.");
    }
    this.arity = "statement";
    return this;
});</pre>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>Functions are executable object values. A function has an optional name
  (so that it can call itself recursively), a list of parameter names wrapped
  in parens, and a body that is a list of statements wrapped in curly braces.
  A function has its own scope.</p>

<pre>prefix("function", function () {
    var a = [];
    new_scope();
    if (token.arity === "name") {
        scope.define(token);
        this.name = token.value;
        advance();
    }
    advance("(");
    if (token.id !== ")") {
        while (true) {
            if (token.arity !== "name") {
                token.error("Expected a parameter name.");
            }
            scope.define(token);
            a.push(token);
            advance();
            if (token.id !== ",") {
                break;
            }
            advance(",");
        }
    }
    this.first = a;
    advance(")");
    advance("{");
    this.second = statements();
    advance("}");
    this.arity = "function";
    scope.pop();
    return this;
});</pre>

<p>Functions are invoked with the <code>(</code> operator. It can take zero or
more comma separated arguments. We look at the left operand to detect
expressions that cannot possibly be function values.</p>

<pre>infix("(", 80, function (left) {
    var a = [];
    if (left.id === "." || left.id === "[") {
        this.arity = "ternary";
        this.first = left.first;
        this.second = left.second;
        this.third = a;
    } else {
        this.arity = "binary";
        this.first = left;
        this.second = a;
        if ((left.arity !== "unary" || left.id !== "function") &&
                left.arity !== "name" && left.id !== "(" &&
                left.id !== "&&" && left.id !== "||" && left.id !== "?") {
            left.error("Expected a variable name.");
        }
    }
    if (token.id !== ")") {
        while (true)  {
            a.push(expression(0));
            if (token.id !== ",") {
                break;
            }
            advance(",");
        }
    }
    advance(")");
    return this;
});</pre>
<p>The <code>this</code> symbol is a special variable. In a method invocation,
  it is the reference to the object. </p>

<pre>symbol("this").nud = function () {
    scope.reserve(this);
    this.arity = "this";
    return this;
};</pre>
<h2>Object Literals</h2>

<p>An array literal is a set of square brackets around zero or
more comma-separated expressions. Each of the expressions is evaluated, and the
results are collected into a new array.</p>

<pre>prefix("[", function () {
    var a = [];
    if (token.id !== "]") {
        while (true) {
            a.push(expression(0));
            if (token.id !== ",") {
                break;
            }
            advance(",");
        }
    }
    advance("]");
    this.first = a;
    this.arity = "unary";
    return this;
});</pre>

<p>An object literal is a set of curly braces around zero or more
comma-separated pairs. A pair is a key/expression pair separated by a
colon (<code>:</code>).
The key is a literal or a name which is treated as a literal.</p>

<pre>prefix("{", function () {
    var a = [];
    if (token.id !== "}") {
        while (true) {
            var n = token;
            if (n.arity !== "name" &amp;&amp; n.arity !== "literal") {
                token.error("Bad key.");
            }
            advance();
            advance(":");
            var v = expression(0);
            v.key = n.value;
            a.push(v);
            if (token.id !== ",") {
                break;
            }
            advance(",");
        }
    }
    advance("}");
    this.first = a;
    this.arity = "unary";
    return this;
});</pre>

<h2>Things to Do and Think About</h2>

<p>The tree could be passed to a code generator, or it could be
passed to an interpreter. Very little computation is required to produce the
tree. And as we saw, very little effort was required to write the programming
that built the tree. </p>

<p>We could make the <code>infix</code> function take an opcode that would
aid in code generation. We could also have it take additional methods that
would be used to do constant folding and code generation.</p>

<p>We could add additional statements (such as <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code>,
  and <code>try</code>), statement labels, more error checking, error recovery,
  and lots more operators. We could add type specification and inference.</p>

<p>We could make our language extensible. With the same ease
that we can define new variables, we can let the programmer add new operators
and new statements. </p>
